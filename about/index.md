# About Me
 
 My name is Spenser, and I'm a nerdy dude who is interested in politics, law, maps, and data. I try to write about those things on this blog. 
 But I may throw some other things in there too.
 
 
 # Work with me
 
 I am currently open to work opportunities, either on a one time/project basis or as a full-time position. Feel free to 
 contact me [here](/contact).
